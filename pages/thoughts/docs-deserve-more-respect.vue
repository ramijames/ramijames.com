    <p>I've been doing technical writing of one sort or another since 1999, when I was doing QA for Altec Lansing's R&D branch in Kfar Saba in Israel. Back then we would put out innovative, new audio related devices like (gasp) USB audio devices that worked on Windows ME and 2000. They were buggy and setting them up wasn't the straightforward thing that it is today.</p>
