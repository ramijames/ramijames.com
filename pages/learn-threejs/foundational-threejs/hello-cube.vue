      <h2>Building our first Three.js scene</h2>

      <p>We're going to step through our first, incredibly boring, Three.js scene. It's just going to be a box. That's it. Nothing fancy. I'm intentionally keeping it dry so that there isn't anything extra that can confuse or distract a new user.</p>

      <p>Don't worry, we'll add some flair in the next article.</p>
